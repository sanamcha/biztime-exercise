node pg biztime exercise 


Step 0: Setup

Create a project folder, a Git repo, and a package.json
Install express and pg via NPM
Add node_modules to .gitignore
Step 1: Add a Database

Create a database, biztime
Load the initial data from data.sql
Fix db.js so that it connects to the database and exports the client object.
Familiarize yourself with the data model.
Step 2: Add Company Routes

Create routes/companies.js with a router in it.

All routes in this file should be found under companies/.

All routes here will respond with JSON responses. These responses will be in an object format where the value is the data from the database.

So, for example, the “get list of companies should return”:

{companies: [{code, name}, ...]}
Assuming result is the result from your query, you could produce this with a line like:

return res.json({companies: result.rows})
These routes need to be given data in JSON format, not the standard “url-encoded form body” — so you’ll need to make sure that your app.js includes the middleware to parse JSON.

Routes Needed

GET /companies
Returns list of companies, like {companies: [{code, name}, ...]}
GET /companies/[code]
Return obj of company: {company: {code, name, description}}

If the company given cannot be found, this should return a 404 status response.

POST /companies
Adds a company.

Needs to be given JSON like: {code, name, description}

Returns obj of new company: {company: {code, name, description}}

PUT /companies/[code]
Edit existing company.

Should return 404 if company cannot be found.

Needs to be given JSON like: {name, description}

Returns update company object: {company: {code, name, description}}

DELETE /companies/[code]
Deletes company.

Should return 404 if company cannot be found.

Returns {status: "deleted"}

Step 3: Add Invoices

Add routes/invoices.js. All routes in this file should be prefixed by /invoices.

GET /invoices
Return info on invoices: like {invoices: [{id, comp_code}, ...]}
GET /invoices/[id]
Returns obj on given invoice.

If invoice cannot be found, returns 404.

Returns {invoice: {id, amt, paid, add_date, paid_date, company: {code, name, description}}}

POST /invoices
Adds an invoice.

Needs to be passed in JSON body of: {comp_code, amt}

Returns: {invoice: {id, comp_code, amt, paid, add_date, paid_date}}

PUT /invoices/[id]
Updates an invoice.

If invoice cannot be found, returns a 404.

Needs to be passed in a JSON body of {amt}

Returns: {invoice: {id, comp_code, amt, paid, add_date, paid_date}}

DELETE /invoices/[id]
Deletes an invoice.

If invoice cannot be found, returns a 404.

Returns: {status: "deleted"}

Also, one route from the previous part should be updated:

GET /companies/[code]
Return obj of company: {company: {code, name, description, invoices: [id, ...]}}

If the company given cannot be found, this should return a 404 status response.
